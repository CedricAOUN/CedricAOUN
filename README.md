I'm a Web/Python developper with some knowledge of C# and game development with Unity. I'm mostly self-educated, but I also have certificates in Web Development at CNAM University, Paris, as well as an online python course at GRETA METEHOR. Programming is a passion for me, so I can learn and adapt to most languages, technologies and software. My capabilities mainly range from Python, Javascript, Wordpress, to softwares like Photoshop, Blender and Unity. 

Professional experience:

- Une Autre Histoire (http://une-autre-histoire.org/fr/)
Description: General cleanup and relooking, as well as the addition of an automatic translation system for new articles so they are available in French and English. 

- Mission Locale, Portes de la brie (https://portesdelabrie.org/)
Description: Full wordpress website, with a large number of functionalities such as a contact form, a job listing service, geolocatisation and more.
